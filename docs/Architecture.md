# Architecture

Ramesses follows **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports & Adapters). The core principle is that business logic has zero knowledge of external systems — it defines what it needs via interfaces (ports), and external systems implement those interfaces (adapters).

## Why Hexagonal

The trading domain — "given market data, decide when to buy or sell" — is pure logic that has nothing to do with Binance. Hexagonal enforces this separation:

- Strategies can be tested with plain Java objects, no Binance API calls
- Swapping from Binance to another exchange means writing one new adapter
- Backtesting reuses the exact same domain logic via `InMemoryMarketDataAdapter`

## Dependency Rules

```
adapter  →  port  ←  domain
```

- **Domain** depends on nothing outside itself
- **Ports** are interfaces defined by the domain
- **Adapters** depend on ports, never on domain internals
- **Spring** is only present in adapters and config — never in domain or ports

## Data Flow

```
SchedulerAdapter  (every N seconds)
  → MarketCheckPort.checkMarket()
      → CheckMarketUseCase
          → MarketDataPort.getLatestBars()       ← BinanceMarketDataAdapter fetches klines
          → TradingStrategy.evaluate(bars)        ← MacDStrategy computes MACD signals
          → TradeExecutionPort.buy() / sell()     ← BinanceTradeExecutionAdapter updates portfolio
```

## Ports Reference

| Port | Direction | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `MarketCheckPort` | Inbound (driving) | Entry point for the scheduler |
| `MarketDataPort` | Outbound (driven) | Fetch OHLCV candlestick bars |
| `TradeExecutionPort` | Outbound (driven) | Execute buy/sell and track portfolio |

## Adding a New Exchange

1. Implement `MarketDataPort` (fetch and convert bars to `MarketBar`)
2. Implement `TradeExecutionPort` (buy/sell logic and portfolio state)
3. Register the new adapters as Spring beans in `AppConfig`

No domain code changes required.

## Adding a New Strategy

1. Implement `TradingStrategy` — accept `List<MarketBar>`, return `TradeSignal`
2. Register it as the `TradingStrategy` bean in `AppConfig`

## Backtesting

Use `InMemoryMarketDataAdapter` with a pre-loaded `List<MarketBar>`:

```java
var bars = new BinanceHistoricalFetcher().fetchHistoricalBars();
var adapter = new InMemoryMarketDataAdapter(bars);
var strategy = new MacDStrategy(config);
var signal = strategy.evaluate(adapter.getLatestBars());
```

For full walk-forward backtesting, use ta4j's `BarSeriesManager` directly (see `MacDStrategyTest`).
